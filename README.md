# RabbitMQ - Crash Course

Based on "RabbitMQ Crash Course" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cie5v59mrTg

RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open source distributed message queue written in Erlang and supports many communication protocols.  It was trying to solve the spaghetti üçù mesh architecture where every client is communicating with other client in System  by introducing an extra layer in the middle. 

(slide) 

In this video we will explain basic components of RabbitMQ Such as AMQP, channel, queue, publisher, consumer and some stuff, we will also learn how to spin up a RabbitMQ server and we will finally write some code to develop a publisher client that post messages to RabbitMQ. We will also write the consumer piece which will be the code that reads rabbitMQ. Finally I will talk about my personal thoughts on this tech.

# Spin up a Linux Server

We use a Linux Server on paperspace.com: 'RabbitMQ' (Ubuntu)

# Check Docker Installation

In the terminal type the following to check if Docker is installed:

```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

You will be prompted as follows if Docker is installed:

```
$ ...
$ Hello from Docker!
$ ...
```

# Install Docker container with RabbitMQ

Name your container (-name): rabbitmq
Set the external port (-p) to the RabbitMQ Server: 5672 (you can choose some other number as well)
Set the internal port (:) to the RabbitMQ Server: 5672 (default port for RabbitMQ Server)
Mention the Image from which to pull the RabbitMQ docker: rabbitmq

```
$ docker run --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq

```

Leave this container to run, switch to another terminal to prevent stopping the container.

# Install Visual Studio Code

To create and modify the Publisher(s) and subscriber(s), we use Visual Studio Code which can be installed for free from https://code.visualstudio.com/

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux

Download the Debian distribution from https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868

Install the downloaded file (replace < file > with the actual file name of the download, e.g. code_xxx):

```
sudo apt install ./<file>.deb
```

Installing the .deb package will automatically install the apt repository and signing key to enable auto-updating using the system's package manager.

```

```
